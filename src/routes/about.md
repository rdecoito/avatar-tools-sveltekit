# Welcome to Check Your Balance
I'm glad you could stop by! This web application has been created to help GMs manage information about their PCs and NPCs in games of [Avatar Legends: The RPG](https://magpiegames.com/), created by [Magpie Games](https://magpiegames.com/). This website is not affiliated with or endorsed by Magpie Games.

This website was created largely as a passion project to learn a new web development framework called [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). I plan on continuing to develop this app to learn more about web development, so check back often for new features! I'll try to add a contact form soon so you can send me feature suggestions or bug reports.

Have fun and happy playing! :)
